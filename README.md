# radiosh
Mac OS X command-line controller for the venerable USB-based Griffin radioSHARK, allowing you to programmatically control its two LED notifiers and tune to arbitrary FM and AM radio stations from scripts and your shell.

This code was based on rslight by [Quentin D. Carnicelli](qdc@rogueamoeba.com), shark by [Michael Rolig](michael_rolig@alumni.macalester.edu) and [Justin Yunke](yunke@productivity.org), and shark2 by [Hisaaki Shibata](shibata@luky.org), refactored by [Cameron Kaiser](ckaiser@floodgap.com). I'm just uploading it here for posterity.
